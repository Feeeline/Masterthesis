In our recent work, we introduced the transient nonlinear wave propagation model (TWPM) for reduced dynamic modeling of multi-component distillation columns with variable holdup, and demonstrated its suitability for optimization and control of single-section distillation columns and simple air separation units [Caspari et al., J. Process Contr., 2020]. We show here that the TWPM is well-suited for reduced modeling of multi-sectional ultra-high-purity distillation columns and enables real-time capable NMPC of complex process ﬂowsheets with tight operational constraints. To demonstrate its performance and accuracy, we apply the TWPM for NMPC of an ultra-high-purity nitrogen air separation unit. We perform an in-silico closed-loop case study comprising a series of load changes. Our approach reduces CPU time by 84 \%, enabling NMPC in real time.},

Hydrogen is produced from water splitting. Next, hydrogen and oxygen are puriﬁed to remove water and traces of chemicals. Finally, ammonia is synthesized in a three bed packed reactor. Two cooling designs were considered, indirect and direct cooling. The ammonia is recovered by condensation using the cold air. Power for compression and electrolysis is obtained from renewable sources either solar, photovoltaic, or wind energy. The process is simulated developing surrogate models for each of the units involved with special attention to the electrolyzer, Linde's column, synthesis reactor and ammonia recovery. In particular, the multibed reactor is modeled rigorously off line to validate the conversions and its operation. The full process is formulated as an MINLP problem. Solar energy and indirect cooling are selected for the production of ammonia. However, the high cost of panels results in high investment capital, over 1500 MV, but promising production cost of ammonia, 1.35V/kg.},

	abstract = {An industrial ammonia synthesis loop is a complex interconnected system. With the synthesis reactor operated at high-pressure levels and with synthesis gas made of hydrogen and nitrogen, a highly efﬁcient process design is necessary in order to meet the requirements in terms of cost-efﬁciency and environmental impact. The evaluation and optimization of different designs in the process synthesis phase are generally done by considering mass and energy balances. However, the conclusions drawn from such an analysis can be misleading and provide, if any, little useful information with respect to system improvement. In order to address these issues, an exergy analysis is used to identify the real thermodynamic inefﬁciencies of a system and its components. Furthermore, a subsequently conducted advanced exergy analysis provides the means to determine the structural interactions within a system and the thermodynamic improvement potential of its components. In this context, two different ammonia synthesis loop conﬁgurations are analyzed. The ﬁrst concept consists of a three-staged adiabatic reactor with intermediate quench cooling, whereas the second design features a cooled reactor.},

	abstract = {Cryogenic air separation is a well-established technology. However, due to its associated energy intensity and hazardousness, new studies are always emerging on this topic. Nevertheless, economic feasibility studies of cryogenic separation plants are still scarce. Studies of this type are essential because installing an air separation unit can also be considered at the design stage of other common industrial projects, such as oxidation/ combustion processes and ammonia production. This study aims to elucidate the technical and economic aspects of a real-size air separation unit and analyze the feasibility of incorporating some alternatives recently proposed in the literature, such as multistage compression with and without an organic Rankine cycle for energy saving, integrated argon column, energy recovery systems in turbines, and a PSA unit for CO2 removal, and in the implementation of a new plant. For this, we performed a rigorous simulation and a robust economic evaluation. Thus, it was possible to identify the main bottlenecks of the process, which may become the subject for future work. As a result, the relevance of the compression (34−36\%) and refrigeration (54−55\%) stages in the capital cost and the importance of conscious electricity (29−32\% of the production costs) and maintenance spending for the process’ economic viability were shown. Flowsheets and economic analysis are presented in detail so that they could be used as a base case for future developments in this ﬁeld.},

	abstract = {The distillation columns of a two-column cryogenic air separation unit (ASU) are responsible for a considerable part of the total ASU ineﬃciencies. The eﬃciency of a conventional distillation column can be increased by distributing the reboiler and condenser duties over a larger part of its length. In an ASU, this can be realized by moving the low-pressure column (LPC) down along the high-pressure column (HPC), thus increasing the number of heat-integrated stages (HI stages). We present an assessment of the eﬀect that such an intensiﬁcation of the heat integration has on the performance of the ASU distillation section, using the entropy production as performance criterion. When keeping the operating pressures ﬁxed, the entropy production in the LPC is replaced by entropy production in the HI stages, without aﬀecting the total entropy production. Reducing the pressure ratio enables a reduction in the LPC entropy production without increasing the contribution of the HI stages. For a probable value of the heattransfer capacity per stage, increasing the pressure in the LPC results in a decrease of 21\% in the total entropy production, while decreasing the pressure in the HPC results in a decrease of 23\%. Decreasing the pressure in the HPC when using an opportunistic heat-transfer capacity yields a decrease of 31\%. The reductions in entropy production materialize eventually as changes in the required ASU compressor, pump, and expander duties. Compared to the addition of either an additional heat exchanger or an additional distillation column, the use of HI stages seems to be the most promising method for improving the thermodynamic performance of a cryogenic ASU. More-detailed experimental data are required to simulate heat-integrated distillation columns accurately.},

	abstract = {The industrial use of cryogenic air separation units started more than 120 years ago. Cryogenic air separation processes produce pure nitrogen, oxygen, and argon, as well as other noble gases. In cryogenic air separation units, the produced amounts of nitrogen and oxygen vary between 200 and 40,000 Nm 3/h and 1000 and 150,000 Nm 3/h, respectively. Different configurations of this process lead to various amounts of gaseous and liquid products. In addition, the purity of the products is affected by the schematic. Oxygen in gaseous or liquid form is typically used in the metallurgical (e.g., steel) industry, in chemical applications (as oxidizer), in power plants (for oxy-fuel combustion processes), as well as in the medical and aerospace sectors. Nitrogen in gaseous or liquid form is used as inert or flushing gas in the chemical industry and as a coolant for different applications. In this chapter, different schematics of air separation units are analyzed. An exergetic analysis is applied in order to identify the thermodynamic inefficiencies and the processes that cause them. Finally, the systems are evaluated from the economic point of view.},

The goal of the paper is to provide an extensive model of exergetic analysis that could be used in an optimization procedure when decisional parameters are changed or structural design modifications are implemented. For each key part of the Air Separation Unit, an exergetic product and fuel were defined and, based on their definition, the coefficient of performance of each functional zone was calculated. The information about the magnitude of the exergetic losses offers solutions for their future recovery. The analysis of the exergy destructions suggests when it is worth making a larger investment. The exergetic analysis of the compression area of the ASU points out an exergy destruction and loss of 37\% from the total plant’s electrical energy input. The exergy loss with the heat transferred to the cooling system of compressors can be recovered; for the exergy destruction portion, the challenge between investment and operating costs should be considered. The exergy destruction of the air separation columns found the High Pressure Column (HPC) to be more destructive than the Low Pressure Column. The share of the exergy destruction in the total plant’s electrical energy input is 8.3\% for the HPC. The local COP of the HPC, calculated depending on the total exergy of the local product and fuel, is 62.66\%. The calculus of the air separation column is performed with the ChemSep simulator.},

	abstract = {Ammonia is a vital chemical with numerous applications. Currently, the primary methods for generating the necessary reactants for ammonia production involve steam methane reforming (SMR) and cryogenic air separation unit (CASU), while the Haber-Bosch process converts these reactants into ammonia. However, the SMR process releases substantial amounts of CO2, making it imperative to employ an efficient and cost-effective CO2 capture technology to mitigate emissions. This investigation focuses on evaluating the cryogenic CO2 capture (CCC) process for blue ammonia production and provides a thorough economic analysis, estimating both the initial investment costs and operational expenses involved in producing blue ammonia. The results indicated that the CCC process can capture 90\% of the CO2 content in the flue gas emitted by the SMR, incurring an energy penalty of 0.724 MJe/kgCO2 while capturing CO2 in the liquid phase with purities exceeding 99.9\%. In this case, the estimated CO2 capture costs would be 18.05, 45.1, and 16.65 USD/ton in 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively. This represents a 40\% reduction compared to the CO2 capture costs associated with conventional amine-based technology. The results of this study indicate that the annual electricity costs for ammonia production increase by 38.5\% and 64.2\% when employing the CCC and amine-based processes, respectively. This investigation employed an isothermal reactor for ammonia synthesis, using the heat from the exothermic reaction in a water ammonia absorption refrigeration cycle (ARC) to condense and purify ammonia. The results show that the ARC system can effectively condense ammonia at 6 ◦C, producing a liquid ammonia stream with 99.3\% purity. This leads to a 95\% reduction in power consumption compared to a vapor compression refrigeration cycle (VCRC). Consequently, this method has the potential to decrease the annual operational costs for ammonia production by 2.92\%, 2.69\%, and 3.13\% in 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively. This study indicated that the hydrogen production unit incurs the highest initial investment costs, as well as operating costs, in the blue ammonia production process, followed by CASU and the Haber-Bosch process.},

	abstract = {Due to its essential use as a fertilizer, ammonia synthesis from nitrogen and hydrogen is considered to be one of the most important chemical processes of the last 100 years. Since then, an enormous amount of work has been undertaken to investigate and develop effective catalysts for this process. Although the catalytic synthesis of ammonia has been extensively studied in the last century, many new catalysts are still currently being developed to reduce the operating temperature and pressure of the process and to improve the conversion of reactants to ammonia. New catalysts for the Haber–Bosch process are the key to achieving green ammonia production in the foreseeable future. Herein, the history of ammonia synthesis catalyst development is briefly described as well as recent progress in catalyst development with the aim of building an overview of the current state of ammonia synthesis catalysts for the Haber–Bosch process. The new emerging ammonia synthesis catalysts, including electride, hydride, amide, perovskite oxide hydride/oxynitride hydride, nitride, and oxide promoted metals such as Fe, Co, and Ni, are promising alternatives to the conventional fused‐Fe and promoted‐Ru catalysts for existing ammonia synthesis plants and future distributed green ammonia synthesis based on the Haber–Bosch process.},

	abstract = {Catalysts for ammonia synthesis/decomposition are very sensitive to poisoning by oxygen-impurities in the feed. Here we show that the ≤1 ppm O-species present in the purest commercially available gasses can lead to a one order of magnitude drop in ammonia synthesis rate for an industrial Fe catalyst. Density Functional Theory calculations show that adsorbed O creates repulsive interactions that repel and destabilize N in neighboring sites. This inhibits the rate limiting N2 dissociation and leads to the lower rate. A K/Ru/C catalyst also suffers from significant O-poisoning although the activity drop is only half as strong as for iron catalysts, indicating that Opoisoning is a general phenomenon across different types of ammonia synthesis catalysts. An industrial Fe-based ammonia synthesis catalyst kept at room temperature can be used as a guard bed to clean the gas, but oxygen can start to penetrate the guard bed already at 4.4 \% O-coverage, and the capacity of a given guard bed therefore needs to be validated before an experimental campaign. Due to the severity of this effect and the unexpectedly low adsorption capacity of guard beds we recommend that future studies of ammonia synthesis and decomposition start by evaluating the efficiency and life-time of the O-removal measures using the protocols established here.},

The methodology is based on the Speciﬁc Exergy Costing (SPECO) approach, in which (a) the fuel and product of a component are deﬁned by taking a systematic record of all exergy additions to and removals from all the exergy streams of the system, and (b) the costs are calculated by applying basic principles from business administration. Thus, a direct link between the deﬁnitions of fuel and product for a component and the corresponding costing equations is established. In particular, the paper shows how to obtain detailed deﬁnitions of exergetic efﬁciencies using separate forms of exergy (thermal, mechanical and chemical) and how, according to these deﬁnitions, to conduct an evaluation of costs associated with all the exergy streams entering and exiting a system component. For this case, the cost equations are presented in a general matrix form. q 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Diﬀerent from the conventional double-column cryogenic process, the new single-column distillation includes a nitrogen compressor acting as a thermal pump, which makes use of the latent thermal energy of the streams in the distillation column. To verify the validity of the proposed separation process, four typical conﬁgurations of the single-column processes are constructed and simulated on the ASPEN PLUS platform with the operation conditions: air ﬂow rate at 50 000 N m3, inlet temperature of the distillation column at 87 K, and various nitrogen compression temperatures. The conventional double-column cryogenic air separation process is also simulated as the base to compare the energy consumptions between the conventional and the novel processes. On the basis of such a comparison, the novel single-column cryogenic air separation process can save energy up to 23\% and produce the products’ purity in industrial standard.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a novel cryogenic air separation process that reduces energy consumption by self-heat recuperation is proposed. In the proposed cryogenic air separation process, heat from the top vapor stream of the column is recuperated and exchanged with heat in the bottom liquid and feed streams, using self-heat recuperation technology. As a result, not only the latent heat but also the sensible heat of the process stream is circulated in the process. Furthermore, the pressure in the column can be decreased compared with the high pressure part of a conventional cryogenic air separation system, in which high and low pressure columns are combined to exchange nitrogen latent heat with oxygen latent heat. Thus, the energy input to the main compressor located before the column can be dramatically reduced. A simulation demonstrated that the energy consumption of the proposed cryogenic air separation process with self-heat recuperation decreased by more than 36\% compared with the conventional cryogenic air separation process, when producing 99.99 mol\% oxygen from air.},

The two different integrated systems were simulated using Aspen HYSYS® and Aspen Custom Modeler® to generate 105 kW of electrical power for a residential application (twenty homes). The energy feasibility was assessed by comparing the total energy consumption with the energy produced by the two integrated options. Due to the initially high energy consumption, Aspen Energy AnalyzerTM was employed to design a heat exchanger network for heat integration. The obtained results based on the heat integration network significantly improved energy efficiency for both alternatives of hydrogen exploitation, demonstrating the feasibility of a circular hydrogen economy.},

This work ﬁrst develops a hydrogen network superstructure with light hydrocarbon recovery. Aspen HYSYS is employed for rigorous process and thermodynamic modeling of the light hydrocarbon recovery process, and a simulation-optimization model is then developed. To solve the simulation-optimization model efﬁciently, the genetic algorithm is used as the global solver to determine the feed to light hydrocarbon recovery unit, and the linprog and fmincon solvers are combined to determine the optimal hydrogen network design. The application and effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through a case study. The results show that fresh hydrogen consumption decreases by 13\% and the total annualized cost reduces to 72\% because of light hydrocarbon recovery. This method could provide useful guides for the management of hydrogen and light hydrocarbons in reﬁneries.},

	abstract = {Chemical looping air separation is a new method to separate oxygen from air. In the process, oxygen carrier releases oxygen in the reduction reactor and absorbs oxygen in the oxidation reactor. The reduction is endothermic, and the oxidation is exothermic. The heat transfer from oxidation reactor to reduction reactor is essential to design the CLAS process with low energy consumption. In this paper, the optimization CLAS process of CuO/ZrO2 oxygen carrier was established based on thermal analysis and pressure analysis. In the system, the heat can achieve self-balance with little heat supplied from outside. The effects of the technological parameters on the system energy consumption were investigated using Aspen Plus software. The results show that the energy consumption decreases with reduction temperature increasing and oxidation temperature decreasing. Moreover, the smaller the difference of temperature between the two reactors is, the lower energy consumption is. Under negative pressure, with the decreasing reduction pressure, the energy consumption decreases. Under positive pressure, with the increasing oxidation pressure, the energy consumption decreases ﬁrstly and then increases. The optimization operating parameters are obtained. The lowest energy consumption of the system is 0.132 kWh m-3 at the conditions of 990 °C reduction and 1000 °C oxidation temperatures and 0.5 atm. reduction and 1.7 atm. oxidation pressures.},

	abstract = {In this study advanced exergy and exergoeconomic analyses are performed on the integrated cryogenic air separation unit (ASU), oxy-fuel carbon dioxide power cycle and LNG vaporization process. Advanced exergy results show that endogenous part of exergy destruction is more than exogenous part which means interactions between the process components is not signiﬁcant. CR-4 compressor with 190,095 kW exogenous exergy destruction rate has the highest share of this type of exergy destruction among the process components. Advanced exergoeconomic analysis results show that interactions between the process components are weak. That is because of large values of endogenous part towards the exogenous part. Among investigated process components unavoidable exergy destruction cost rate of heat exchanger (H-1) and combustion chamber is higher than the avoidable part. Avoidable/endogenous exergy destruction cost rate of P-1, CR-1 and H-8 components is the highest and consequently these elements will have the highest priority for the optimization. The capital investment and operating and maintenance cost rate of pump (P-1) is 10,018 \$/h. This value reveals that saving the money from the operating and maintenance costs will make up the replacement cost of this component with the hightech ones.

	abstract = {This study proposes the recovery of organics and nitrogen from sewage through membrane-based preconcentration (MPC) combined with ion exchange (IE) process. Unlike conventional activated sludge process, MPC–IE redesigned organic carbon ﬂow to increase chemical oxygen demand (COD) conversion for energy recovery via anaerobic digestion (AD). This process also achieved nitrogen recovery instead of destruction. Membrane-based pre-concentration of COD was conducted using actual sewage for one month. As high as 65\% COD was recovered. Batch IE adsorption and regeneration experiments were conducted. However, these experiments recovered only 37.5\% NH4-N because of the selectivity of IE for hard ions over ammonium. Despite the low rate of recovery, the process could achieve a total of 0.38 kWh/m3 energy recovery by combining energy production with anaerobic digestion of pre-concentrated organics (0.26 kWh/m3) and energy saving via nitrogen reuse (0.12 kWh/m3). Highly efﬁcient energy and nitrogen recovery from sewage via MPC–IE process was expected after optimization.},

The first process refers to a three-column cryogenic air separation plant without using an external refrigeration system. An integrated process including cryogenic air separation, combined-cycle power plants (e.g., transcritical CO2 cycle and gas turbine), and LNG regasification was presented and analyzed as the second process to produce liquid oxygen and vaporize LNG without using external refrigeration source. Results of the first proposed process demonstrate that the specific energy consumption of high purity nitrogen, oxygen, and argon reduces to 18.7\%, 13\%, and 12\% respectively when compared with the conventional processes. Specific energy consumptions and exergy efficiency for the second plant improved by nearly 33\% and 16\% in comparison with the first process. Also, the gas turbine and CO2 power cycle efficiencies were almost 35\% and 45\% in the second process. Exergy analysis on both systems demonstrated that expansion valve V-2 (99.42\%), high-pressure distillation columns (99.41\%), and argon recovery section (98.34\%) have the lowest irreversibility and highest exergy efficiency. Meanwhile, the highest exergy destructions in the first and second proposed plants belong to the low-pressure distillation tower of the first process and the combustion chamber of the second process with around 3400 kW and 24,000 kW respectively.},

In this work, the conceptual process for biogas upgrading using aqueous choline chloride (ChCl)/urea (1:2 on a molar basis) was developed, simulated and evaluated based on the commercialized software Aspen Plus. Reliable thermophysical properties and phase equilibria are prerequisite for carrying out process simulation. In order to carry out the process simulation, the thermophysical properties of ChCl/Urea (1:2) and its aqueous solutions as well as the phase equilibria of gas-ChCl/Urea (1:2), ChCl/Urea (1:2)-H2O and gas-ChCl/Urea (1:2)-H2O were surveyed and evaluated. After evaluation, the consistent experimental data of these thermophysical properties were ﬁtted to the models embedded in Aspen Plus. The properties needed but without available experimental results were predicted theoretically. The Non-Random Two-Liquid model and the Redlich-Kwong equation (NRTL-RK) model were used to describe the phase equilibria. The equilibrium approach was used for process simulation. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the reasonable operating parameters. With a set of reasonable operating conditions, the effects of ChCl/Urea (1:2) content on the total energy utilization, the diameters and pressure drops of absorber and desorber as well as the environmental assessment of the process were studied. The simulation results showed that, with the addition of ChCl/Urea (1:2), the total energy utilization decreased by 16\% compared to the process with pure water, and the diameters of both absorber and desorber decreased with increasing content of ChCl/Urea (1:2). The process using aqueous ChCl/Urea (1:2) was more environmentally benign than that with pure water. Therefore, aqueous ChCl/Urea (1:2) is a promising solvent for biogas upgrading.},

	abstract = {Although experimental studies on the impact of feed (FS) and draw solutions (DS) on the forward osmosis (FO) applications are reported in literature, systematic mathematical modeling considering the dynamic change in solution properties is lacking. In this study, asymmetric FO membrane simulation model was established using Aspen Plus-MATLAB subroutines algorithm to account for the effect of concentration polarization (CP), types of FS and DS and in their properties on FO performance. The developed model was validated by comparing the simulation with experimental results. The model successfully predict the performance of FO process under wide varieties of operational conditions, FS and DS ﬂow rates and concentrations. The model showed that the variation of MCFDS concentration had a marked effect on water ﬂux (WF) in contrast to ﬂow rate. The WFs obtained from seawater (SW) increased from 5.28 L/m2.h to 42.08 L/m2.h as MCFDS changes from 150 g/L to 300 g/L which corresponding to 11.66\% to 45.33\% of water recovery. As for synthetic aquaculture wastewater (SAWW), 9.70 L/m2.h to 37.32 L/m2.h of WFs were exhibited with the increase of MCFDS concentration from 50 g/L to 200 g/L, respectively. The effect of concentrated external CP (CECP) was found to be signiﬁcant in case of SW and negligible with SAWW. Whereas, increasing MCFDS concentration increases the severity effect of dilutive internal CP (DICP). The degree of DICP depends on the solute resistivity (KD) of porous layer, which were elevated (4.22–5.88 s/m) as MCFDS concentration increases (150–300 g/L). The study demonstrated the effectiveness and suitability of the developed Aspen Plus-MATLAB model simulating the FO process.},

At the same time, the electricity required by the Air Separation Unit to generate the oxygen, leads to a penalty in energy eﬃciency that puts at stake its economic feasibility. In order to overcome that criticality, an opportunity is oﬀered by the possibility to exploit one of the main by-products of the Air Separation Units (i.e. liquid nitrogen) by means of a high eﬃciency open Rankinecycle expander, namely the Dearman Engine (i.e. cryogenic engine). The proposed research investigates the feasibility of an integrated system - Waste-to-Energy plant, Air Separation Unit and Dearman Engine - in terms of technical, economic and environmental performance indices such as power output, economic savings, incremental income and pollutant emissions reduction. The results show that, under opportune conditions (i.e. liquid nitrogen utilization factor and diesel price higher than 83\% and 1.08 USD/kg, respectively) the penalty in energy eﬃciency coming from the integration between the Waste-to-Energy plant and the Air Separation Unit can be compensated, both economically, with a pay-back time inferior to 10 years, and environmentally (saving 23 kton/year of CO2), by means of the valorisation of the liquid nitrogen through the Dearman Engine.},

The system was designed to detect ammonia using an in-line purging system coupled with a newly designed gas converging ﬂow cell incorporating in-line paper-based colorimetric detection. The gas converging ﬂow cell served as a gas chamber, a paper-based device holder, and a color detection cell. The paper-based device was impregnated with butterﬂy pea extract (a natural acid-base indicator), the color of which changed on the basis of the generated ammonia gas. Analytical parameters such as concentration of natural indicator and purging time were studied and optimized. The color image could be captured by an integrated endoscope camera or smartphone and analyzed by ImageJ software in RGB mode. Under optimal conditions, two linear dynamic ranges were observed. By using 1:2 (v/v) diluted 2\% (w/v) butterﬂy pea extract in Milli-Q water, a low linear concentration range of 0.05–0.9 mg L−1 with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.02 mg L−1 and limit of quantiﬁcation (LOQ) of 0.05 mg L−1 was achieved. By using a non-diluted 2\% (w/v) butterﬂy pea extract, a high linear concentration range of 0.5–4 mg L−1 with an LOD of 0.1 mg L−1 and LOQ of 0.3 mg L−1 was obtained. Finally, the optimized method was leveraged to determine ammonia-N in various water samples from shrimp farming.},

The equations of exergy destruction and exergetic efﬁciency for the main cycle units such as evaporators, condensers, compressors, and expansion valves are developed. Exergetic efﬁciency of the refrigeration cycle is determined to be 33.9\% indicating a high potential for improvements. The simulation results reveal that the exergy loss and exergetic efﬁciencies of the air cooler and expansion sections respectively are the lowest among the compartments of the cycle. The coefﬁcient of performance (COP) is obtained as 2.05. Four parts of irreversibility (avoidable/unavoidable) and (endogenous/exogenous) are calculated for the units with highest inefﬁciencies. The advanced exergy analysis reveals that the exergy destruction has two major contributors: (1) 59.61\% of the exergy is lost in the unavoidable form in all units and (2) compressors contribute to 25.47\% of the exergy destruction. So there is a high potential for improvement for these units, since 63.38\% of this portion is avoidable.},

In this paper, a computer-aided methodology combining COSMO-based molecular simulations and Aspen Plus process simulations has been used to study the extraction process of aromatic hydrocarbons from pyrolysis gasoline employing a binary mixture of 1-ethyl-4-methylpyridinium bis(triﬂuoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([4empy][NTf2]) and the 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide ([emim][DCA]) ILs as solvent. An extensive comparison (more than 600 points) between experimental data and the predictions obtained by the COSMO-based thermodynamic model of liquid–liquid and vapor–liquid equilibria and ILs physical properties was made for validation purposes. Process simulations were performed in three system conﬁgurations: with one, two, or three ﬂash distillations in the IL recovery section. The potential advantage of using binary IL-IL mixture as extracting solvent was studied in the whole range of composition. The conﬁguration with three ﬂash distillations and the binary IL-IL mixture with a 75\% of [4empy][NTf2] were selected as the optimal conditions to increase aromatic recovery and purity, improving the separation performance respect to the neat ILs.},

	abstract = {The rapid integration of intermittent renewable sources into the electricity grid is driving the need for a flexible cryogenic air separation unit (ASU) coupled with a low-carbon fossil-fuel plant. However, the state-of-the-art ASU process is highly integrated and nonlinear, which can significantly restrict its ramping rate. In this work, we study the fundamental dynamics of a state-of-the-art double-column ASU, focusing on the dynamic characteristics of the highly integrated and nonlinear heat and mass transfers, and we propose basic control methods for achieving high process ramping rates. We found that the vapor–liquid countercurrent flows in the low-pressure column are critical to the cryogenic rectification of air, which governs the ramp rate of the ASU. This countercurrent flow structure is created through a complex heat integration process in the ASU. Here, this process is simplified as a countercurrent heat transfer to reduce the complexity of studying the ASU dynamics. To preserve this flow structure, the heat integration is maintained so that its heat duty follows the ASU load, using several basic controllers on the critical stream flowrates. A flow-driven dynamic ASU model is built in Aspen Plus Dynamics to capture the basic ramping dynamics. This model revealed a fundamental mismatch in the dynamics in the ASU column that causes a significant loss of O2 product purity when ramping down the ASU and slightly increases the purity when ramping up. Based on these findings, we propose a basic control method for rapidly ramping down/up the ASU while maintaining O2 product purity. Simulation results show the ASU basic dynamic process successfully ramps at a rate up to 10 \%/min (40–100 \% load) while maintaining the O2 product purity at 95.2–95.6 mol\%.},

Three technologies have been compared, membrane separation, pressure swing adsorption and a Linde’s double column. Hydrogen is produced from water splitting using solar, photovoltaic, or wind energy. Finally, ammonia is synthesized in a three bed packed reactor. Two reactor designs were evaluated, direct and indirect cooling. The process is optimized by solving an NLP for each reactor design and nitrogen technology combination and for several production capacities, evaluating the operating and investment costs resulting from the need to use a number of parallel units. The production capacity defines the best technology depending on its characteristics. The results show that for very low production membranes are recommended, medium capacities should be produced using PSA while large require the use of distillation. The actual transition points have been computed. The high costs of panels and electrolyzers mitigate the issues related to duplicating small units. The expected decrease in the cost of both will result in competitive renewable ammonia production costs. Correlations for the investment and production costs as a function of the scale have been developed.},

The feed conditions (500 tons/h, and 50\% relative humidity of air), product purities (99 mole\% for both nitrogen and oxygen), and operational conditions (pressures of both distillation columns) are kept same in all designs. The two cryogenic distillation columns in each conﬁguration are heat-integrated to eliminate the need for external utilities. Steady-state simulation results are used to calculate the exergy eﬃciency (\%) of each equipment as well as its contribution toward the overall exergy destruction rate (kW) of the process. The results show that the compression section is a major source of exergy destruction, followed by the low-pressure column, and the multi-stream heat exchanger.

	abstract = {Traditionally, high-purity argon recovery from air is considerably difﬁcult owing to the boiling point of argon close to that of oxygen. Recently with the increasing demands for argon, another attractive source of ammonia purge gas has been paid more attention. In this paper with an objective of minimizing energy consumption per argon product, the two-column process for recovering argon from hydrogen-depleted ammonia purge gas is analyzed and optimized in detail on the ASPEN PLUS platform. Firstly, the model of two-column process is set up using the standard unit operation blocks and PENG-ROB property method of ASPEN PLUS, in which validation of PENG-ROB property method is carried out by comparison with a total 623 experimental data from three aspects: vapor–liquid equilibrium, liquid phase density, and enthalpy. It is followed by the thermodynamic and simulation and sensitivity analysis, which on the one hand can reduce the number of decision variables related to optimization problem, and on the other hand can obtain reasonable parameter speciﬁcation, variables initial values and ranges, thus effectively ensuring the later optimization algorithm converges quickly and accurately. Finally the built-in sequential quadratic programming (SQP) solver of ASPEN PLUS is adopted to solve the minimum energy consumption optimization problem of twocolumn process. On the processor of 2.66 GHz Intel(R) Core (TM)2 Duo CPU with 4 GB RAM, the whole optimization only takes CPU times 10 s or so to accomplish. The optimal results show that thermal state of feed to demethanizer is a very efﬁcient and valuable means to reduce system energy consumption which at TC05 = 103 K is only 87.4\% of that at TC05 = 109 K where TC05 is the temperature of feed to demethanizer directly reﬂecting its thermal state. The condensing pressure of hydrogen-depleted ammonia purge gas also plays a vital role in reducing system energy consumption which is less at higher condensing pressure, whereas it almost has no inﬂuence on the yield and purity of argon recovery. The optimal operating pressure of ﬂash separator used to remove the residual hydrogen in the feed hydrogen-depleted ammonia purge gas is 0.4–0.6 MPa (A); the most economical reﬂux ratio of argon distillation column is 1.15, and that of demethanizer varies from 0.33 to 0.45 depending on thermal state of feed to demethanizer. © 2010 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

	abstract = {This paper has discussed and simulated diﬀerent low oxygen-purity air separation processes with or without argon recovery to ﬁnd out eﬃcient air separation process using HYSYS platform, and proposed a novel mixingcolumn process that provides high argon recovery rate based on energy saving eﬀect. For comparison, all the proposed cases are simulated under the same process conditions of 50,000 Nm3/h feed air, 95\% gaseous oxygen purity, 0.03 MPa gauge pressure, and 300 Nm3/h liquid oxygen output. Three main performance parameters including oxygen recovery rate, energy consumption and argon recovery rate are compared, and the simulation results show that among ﬁve types of processes without argon recovery, the triple-column process, whose energy requirement decreases by 14.9\% compared with conventional dual-column process, achieves the lowest energy consumption. Argon production is required in many aspects during air separation process. The feasibility of argon recovery in low oxygen-purity air separation process is studied. The process with argon recovery named mixing-column process is proposed, whose argon recovery rate can reach up to 60.88\%, which further increases up to 62.23\% with the optimized raw argon ﬂow rate and mixing-ingredient. The energy consumption of the proposed mixing-column process is decreased by 3.5\% compared with conventional dual-column process, while the argon recovery rate of the triple-column process can only reach to 4.55\% in despite of energy saving by 12\%. In addition, more stable argon recovery performance as well as higher argon recovery rate is realized by this novel process when using varied oxygen purity in low oxygen-purity (≤99\%) process.},

	abstract = {The process of a large-scale air separation unit is simulated based on the industrial process and operational parameter of a petrochemical company by using ASPEN PLUS. The actual operating performance is analyzed for the total site. According to the simulation results, exergy efficiency of major equipment is analyzed. The optimization problem can be solved by a new algorithm, which combines genetic algorithm with linear programming. Accordingly a modified air separation process is proposed. The equipment deficiency is overcome in the new process. Also the nitrogen expansion and the structure packing column are added. Meanwhile the pinch analysis is done for the new process. The results of the pinch analysis considering the impact of phase transition agree better with industrial data than those without doing so. The energy consumption can be 7.55MW lower than the original process. The total energy efficiency can be raised by 27.21\%. Finally seven unified principles for energy saving, which can be widely used in air separation process, are summarized.},

	abstract = {In this article, a novel single-column atmospheric cryogenic air separation process is proposed to reduce energy consumption through the implementation of thermal pump technique. Diﬀerent from the conventional double-column cryogenic process, the new single-column distillation includes a nitrogen compressor acting as a thermal pump, which makes use of the latent thermal energy of the streams in the distillation column. To verify the validity of the proposed separation process, four typical conﬁgurations of the single-column processes are constructed and simulated on the ASPEN PLUS platform with the operation conditions: air ﬂow rate at 50 000 N m3, inlet temperature of the distillation column at 87 K, and various nitrogen compression temperatures. The conventional double-column cryogenic air separation process is also simulated as the base to compare the energy consumptions between the conventional and the novel processes. On the basis of such a comparison, the novel single-column cryogenic air separation process can save energy up to 23\% and produce the products’ purity in industrial standard.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a novel cryogenic air separation process that reduces energy consumption by self-heat recuperation is proposed. In the proposed cryogenic air separation process, heat from the top vapor stream of the column is recuperated and exchanged with heat in the bottom liquid and feed streams, using self-heat recuperation technology. As a result, not only the latent heat but also the sensible heat of the process stream is circulated in the process. Furthermore, the pressure in the column can be decreased compared with the high pressure part of a conventional cryogenic air separation system, in which high and low pressure columns are combined to exchange nitrogen latent heat with oxygen latent heat. Thus, the energy input to the main compressor located before the column can be dramatically reduced. A simulation demonstrated that the energy consumption of the proposed cryogenic air separation process with self-heat recuperation decreased by more than 36\% compared with the conventional cryogenic air separation process, when producing 99.99 mol\% oxygen from air.},

	abstract = {Two process designs of a cryogenic ASU (air separation unit) have been evaluated using exergy analysis. The ASU is part of an IGCC (integrated gasiﬁcation combined cycle); it is supplying oxygen and nitrogen to the gasiﬁer and nitrogen to the gas turbine. The two process designs separate the same feed into products with the same speciﬁcations. They differ in the number of distillation columns that are used; either two or three. Addition of the third column reduced the exergy destruction in the distillation section with 31\%. Overall, the three-column design destroyed 12\% less exergy than the two-column design. The rational exergy efﬁciency is deﬁned as the desired exergy change divided by the total exergy change; it is 38\% for the three-column design and 35\% for the two-column design. Almost half of the exergy destruction is located in compressor after-coolers. Using this heat of compression elsewhere in the IGCC can be an important way to increase the IGCC efﬁciency. It is proposed to use it for the preheating of ASU products or for the production of steam, which can be used as part of the steam turbine cycle.},

	abstract = {This case study analyzes a cryogenic air separation unit (ASU) with a production of V˙O2=58,300 [m3Nh] of gaseous oxygen with a concentration greater than 98.5\%, operating in Romania on a steel plant platform. The goal of the paper is to provide an extensive model of exergetic analysis that could be used in an optimization procedure when decisional parameters are changed or structural design modifications are implemented. For each key part of the Air Separation Unit, an exergetic product and fuel were defined and, based on their definition, the coefficient of performance of each functional zone was calculated. The information about the magnitude of the exergetic losses offers solutions for their future recovery. The analysis of the exergy destructions suggests when it is worth making a larger investment. The exergetic analysis of the compression area of the ASU points out an exergy destruction and loss of 37\% from the total plant’s electrical energy input. The exergy loss with the heat transferred to the cooling system of compressors can be recovered; for the exergy destruction portion, the challenge between investment and operating costs should be considered. The exergy destruction of the air separation columns found the High Pressure Column (HPC) to be more destructive than the Low Pressure Column. The share of the exergy destruction in the total plant’s electrical energy input is 8.3\% for the HPC. The local COP of the HPC, calculated depending on the total exergy of the local product and fuel, is 62.66\%. The calculus of the air separation column is performed with the ChemSep simulator.},
